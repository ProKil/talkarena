# Introduction
As AI Assistants' capability expands beyond text into other modalities like audio,
they enable new forms of interactions between humans and AI. On the other hand,
most benchmarks for audio processing primarily focus on transcribing and analyzing user speech.
We introduce **Talk Arena**, an interactive open platform to evaluate Large Audio Models through *interactions with
users in real-world settings*. It helps to assess whether previous static benchmarks are valuable measures of model quality,
or whether there is need for a new evaluation paradigm for Large Audio Models.
We evaluate large audio models using *18 speech comprehension datasets* and **Talk Arena**.

## Looking Forward

**Moving Forward.** We are inspired by the ways that the Chatbot Arena has rapidly accelerated the research focus on real-world usage of Chatbot models. As we look ahead, we hope that we can similarly focus the development of Speech LLMs on what users want, rather than what current benchmarks can measure.
- **Bringing Human Preferences to Audio** While the current platform does not store query data, we are excited to start discussions with the community about what data the general public is willing to contribute. Unlike text, speech data is inherently personally identifiable. This means that both consent to data contribution and the careful release of this data is especially important. By working in the open, we hope to find a way to bring a wide range of perspectives to make Large Audio Models useful for everyone who wants to use them.
- **Free-Form Conversational Data** Unlike text chat, spoken conversations are often free-flowing. This means there can be many turns in a short period of time and speakers can interrupt one another! This is part of what makes the modality desirable, but it presents challenges for Arena-style evaluation. We're excited to dig into how we can extend this user-centric evaluation paradigm to all the new ways people are chatting to virtual assistants with speech.
- **Building Better Static Benchmarks** Human evaluation is not a feasible way to guide model development. It is slow and often expensive. We hope that the insights derived from our interactive evaluation can help guide the creation of new static benchmarks that better correlate with real-world usage and user preference.

Ethics and Disclosure

This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the researchers' institution, and we obtained participant consent with a standard institutional consent form. 

For the Prolific study, we stored users queries as well as rationale about why they picked their votes. While our focus is on understanding model behaviours that are desirable, doing this analysis required storing this personally identifiable information. As such, this study was approved under Expedited Review Categories 6 and 7 for the collection of voice for research purposes and research employing survey methods. All participants were paid 15 dollars an hour on the prolific platform.

The public platform, on the other hand, **does not store any information about you or your queries for further research** or release. All recordings are erased after you submit your votes and vote data are stored to understand model performance, but no information about your requests is stored. The public platform sends data to third-party APIs from OpenAI and Google. In both cases, we utilize paid APIs for which the terms of service dictate that your data will not be used for training or stored for more than 30 days. Based on the lack of identifiable information and the focus on model rankings, the Stanford IRB has determined that this public platform is not human subects research as defined in 45 CFR 46.102(e).
