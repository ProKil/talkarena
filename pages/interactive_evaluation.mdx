# Interactive Evaluation

### User Preference

As an initial effort, we collected a total 5000 votes on Prolific using Talk Arena for pairwise comparisons among GPT4o,
Gemini-1.5-pro, Typhoon, Qwen2-Audio and DiVA, which are top performing models from the results of static evaluation.
For each of the ten combinations, we collect 500 votes from more than 50 different crowdworkers.

### Comparison with Static Evaluation

We compare the user preference result in interactive evaluation to that of static evaluation by computing the top-k Kendall Tau Distance between rank in static evaluation and that in interactive evaluation:

<KendallTauDistanceChart />

Here are some observations:
1. **None** of the static bench reflects exactly the same rank in interactive eval
2. Ranks on **emotion recognition** and **language detection** benchmarks are most similar to that in interactive eval
3. Ranks on **gender detection** and **nuanced intent (humor, sarcasm) detection** are not so correlated with that in interactive eval

These are our observations from Prolific study, and we hope to reach more conclusions with the vote from the public.
